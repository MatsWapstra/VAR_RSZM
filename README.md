# VAR_RSZM

This repository contains the selected dataset with no lagged variables and a codefile containing the possibility to run either hdgc_var_all or hdgc_var from the HDGCVar package.
The no lagged variables comment is mainly based on the dataset you have. In the dataset used for this project we worked with multiple variables an example would be VWC_5 and VWC_5_lag3.
These two variables were different variables within the dataset but are simply one and the same with a difference of three lags between them. Upon removing this any errors were removed.
